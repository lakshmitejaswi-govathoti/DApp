# DAO Proposal Optimizer - One Trillion Agents Hackathon

This project is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the NEAR blockchain for the One Trillion Agents Hackathon. It aims to improve DAO governance by providing an agent-based system for analyzing and optimizing proposals before they are put to a vote.

## Features

*   **Proposal Submission:** Users can submit DAO proposals through the dApp.
*   **Agent-Driven Analysis:** A suite of agents analyzes proposals for clarity, impact, community sentiment, comparisons, and risks.
*   **Optimization Suggestions:** Agents provide feedback and suggestions to proposal creators.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Proposal creators can refine proposals based on agent feedback.
*   **NEAR Integration:** Seamlessly interacts with the NEAR blockchain.

## Technologies Used

*   **Blockchain:** NEAR Protocol
*   **Smart Contract:** Rust (recommended) or AssemblyScript
*   **Frontend:** React
*   **Backend/Agents:** Python (with libraries like NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn)
*   **Storage:** IPFS (for larger proposal data)

## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
    *   NEAR CLI: `npm install -g near-cli`
    *   IDE (e.g., VS Code)
    *   NEAR Wallet (testnet recommended)
    *   Python 3.x

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dao-proposal-optimizer.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dao-proposal-optimizer.git)
    cd dao-proposal-optimizer
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *   Frontend: `cd frontend && npm install`
    *   Contracts: `cd contracts && npm install` (within your NEAR contract project)
    *   Agents: Set up virtual environments for your agents and install required Python packages (e.g., `pip install nltk spacy scikit-learn`).

## Development

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Planning

1.  **Create Project Structure:** (See the structure in the main README description)

2.  **Initialize Projects:**
    *   Frontend: `npx create-react-app frontend`
    *   Contracts: `near init contracts` (follow NEAR documentation for contract setup)

### Phase 2: Smart Contract Development (NEAR)

```rust
// contracts/src/lib.rs (Example - Proposal Storage)
use near_sdk::borsh::{self, BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize};
use near_sdk::{near_bindgen, AccountId, Timestamp};
use near_sdk::collections::LookupMap;


#[near_bindgen]
#[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize, Clone)]
pub struct Proposal {
    pub proposal_text: String,
    pub proposer: AccountId,
    pub timestamp: Timestamp,
    // ... other fields (status, IPFS hash, agent results, etc.)
}

#[near_bindgen]
pub struct Contract {
    proposals: LookupMap<u64, Proposal>, //Proposal ID and proposal data
    next_proposal_id: u64,
    // ... other state variables
}

#[near_bindgen]
impl Contract {
    #[init]
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            proposals: LookupMap::new(b"proposals"),
            next_proposal_id: 0,
            // ...
        }
    }

    pub fn submit_proposal(&mut self, proposal_text: String) {
        let proposal = Proposal {
            proposal_text,
            proposer: env::predecessor_account_id(),
            timestamp: env::block_timestamp(),
            // ...
        };
        self.proposals.insert(&self.next_proposal_id, &proposal);
        self.next_proposal_id += 1;
        // Emit an event (important for the frontend to know about new proposals)
    }
    // ... other contract functions
}
```

### Phase 3: Agent Development (Python)

```python
# agents/clarity_agent/clarity_agent.py
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize

def analyze_clarity(text):
    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
    num_sentences = len(sentences)
    # ... (NLP logic to analyze readability, grammar, etc.)
    return {"readability_score": ..., "grammar_issues": ...}

# Example of interacting with NEAR (using near-cli or a Python library):
# from near_cli import ...  (or a suitable library)

# proposal_text = near.view_call(contract_address, "get_proposal", {"proposal_id": 1})
# clarity_analysis = analyze_clarity(proposal_text)
# near.call(contract_address, "store_clarity_report", {"proposal_id": 1, "report": clarity_analysis})
```

### Phase 4: Frontend Development (React)

```javascript
// frontend/src/components/ProposalForm.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import * as nearAPI from 'near-api-js'; // Import near-api-js
// ...

function ProposalForm({ near, contract }) { // Pass near and contract instances
  const [proposalText, setProposalText] = useState('');

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    try {
      await contract.submit_proposal({ proposal_text: proposalText }); // Call contract function
      // ... handle success (e.g., clear form, show message)
    } catch (error) {
      // ... handle error
    }
  };

  // ... (rest of the form code)
}

export default ProposalForm;
```

### Phase 5: Integration and Testing

*   Connect the React frontend to the NEAR smart contract using `near-api-js`.
*   Implement the logic to trigger the Python agents (e.g., using a background task or serverless functions).
*   Thoroughly test all components.

### Phase 6: Deployment and Submission

*   Deploy NEAR contracts to testnet.
*   Deploy the React frontend.
*   Prepare submission materials (description, video).

**Key Improvements:**

*   **Table of Contents:** Makes navigation easier.
*   **More Detailed Steps:** Provides more specific guidance within each phase.
*   **Code Snippets:** Includes example code for smart contracts, agents, and frontend interactions.  These are simplified examples, but they give a good starting point.
*   **NEAR Integration:** Shows how to use `near-api-js` in the frontend and provides an example of contract interaction.
*   **Agent Interaction:**  Gives a basic idea of how agents might interact with the NEAR contract.

Remember: This is still a high-level guide.  Each step will require more detailed research and implementation.  The code examples are simplified and will need to be adapted to your specific requirements.  Use the NEAR documentation, React documentation, and relevant Python libraries for more in-depth information.  As you work through the project, break down each phase into smaller, more manageable tasks.  If you have specific questions about a particular part of the development, feel free to ask!
